1. segment defination 
-select the critical buses which need to be preserved manually.
-define the segment by inital node and final node

-function to get voltages of the preserved nodes (done)
-function to get current of the initial and final branch 
 problems(have to manually select the intial and final branch, difficult to use a script, won't be easy to get the correct result)
-functions to compute the Z and S values
-function to insert the new lines
-function to insert S



3. define junctions


4. Collect data on junctions

5. delet the unnessary buses
